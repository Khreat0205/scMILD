# scMILD: Single-cell Multiple Instance Learning for Disease classification and associated subpopulation Discovery

We propose scMILD, a weakly supervised learning framework based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), which leverages sample-level labels to identify condition-associated cell subpopulations. By treating samples as bags and cells as instances, scMILD effectively learns cell-level representations and improves sample classification performance.
